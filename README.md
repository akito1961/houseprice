# House Price Prediction

This project is an exploration into regression techniques for predicting house prices, based on the [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) competition on Kaggle.

As I begin my data career journey, this repository serves as a practical application of data cleaning, feature engineering, and model building. I hope it inspires others who are also starting their path in the world of data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/house-price-prediction.git
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```
2. It is recommended to create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(Note: A `requirements.txt` file should be created for this step to work. You can generate one with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`)*

## Usage

The main analysis is contained within the Jupyter Notebook. To run it, start the Jupyter server:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Then, open the `analysis.ipynb` (or your notebook's name) file from the Jupyter interface in your browser.
